## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

Second challenge in this platform, in which I took the risk to use the div tag and work with the classes using the BEM methodology; I also tried a little drastic modification in the css sentences when adapting the design to desktop since the design has a different composition in this version. I hope to continue testing myself with this type of compositions.
